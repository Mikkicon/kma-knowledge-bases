From a business perspective, the key to think-cell's success is a unique solution to a pressing business problem. Our customers and users are influential professionals who are extremely satisfied with our software and help spread it by word of mouth.We take great pride in our software, and have an excellent reputation for our technical support. Independently, you handle problems from the receipt of a support ticket to its analysis, tracing problems all the way to their resolution in development.About this jobWhen you receive a ticket, our customer should get timely and reliable feedback, usually within a few hours, either with the solution or a suggestion for further troubleshooting. When a phone call or a remote support session is needed, you will quickly realize that our customers are busy people, and that you must use your time well. Ask the right questions, be perceptive of the little things, and use the right tools to find the unusual configuration, the virus, the third party tool, the particular file or action that is causing trouble.Once you have found the problem and talked it through with one of the developers, we will make sure that this same problem does not bother you again. If it is in our code, we will fix it, no questions asked. If the bug is in third party code, you will contact the vendor and convince them to fix it. Quite often they do, even the big names. If they don't, you write a knowledge base article, which is searchable on our web site. 90% of your time you will spend on problems that you have never seen before, which will keep up the challenge.Besides working on tickets, you will evaluate new tools that may help you in your work, or even write them yourself or work with one of our developers. We at think-cell have our own automatic error reporting framework and ship a diagnostic tool, both of which are constantly being improved – soon, perhaps, by you.The qualities we are looking for are similar to those of a software developer, with the same strong problem-solving abilities, but a bit less emphasis on algorithmic skills and in return more emphasis on organizational and communication skills. Experience with the Windows architecture is a plus. If you have analyzed a minidump before, even better.

To achieve this deep integration, we use the public APIs offered by Office and Windows whenever we can, but unfortunately, they do not let us do everything we want to do. So we add our own customization hooks into the Office and Windows binaries. When think-cell loads, it finds the code locations and installs its hooks.Instead of using fixed addresses, we find code locations using machine code patterns to be robust against minor changes. If an update to Office or Windows still breaks some of the patterns, think-cell will automatically download and install any available version with updated patterns.Finding ways to achieve a desired customization is a truly zen-like activity. It requires deep analytical skills, the ability to juggle vast amounts of information in the head and quickly separate promising from less promising approaches."

Challenges are plenty: from a solid understanding of what makes a good layout and which guidelines are followed by humans who do manual layout, to algorithms that produce an acceptable output fast enough for interactive slide design, to a graphical user interface that supports our new, original approach to slide layout in a way that is easy to understand yet unobtrusive, to solid technical solutions for automatic bug reporting and automatic updates, to compatibility with third-party software on the computers of half a million users.Here are some highlights of what we have doneLanguage- Everything we do is C++. Even our customer portal is written in C++. There is some Assembler glue code where it is necessary, and our build scripts are written in Python, but other than that think-cell is all about C++;- We closely track the latest versions of our compilers, Visual C++ and Xcode, so we can always use the latest C++ standard features as soon as they become available;- We fund the working group for programming languages of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN). Some of our employees are members of this committee and vote in the international standardization process of ISO/IEC C++;- We sponsor the Standard C++ Foundation helping them to promote the understanding and use of modern Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms.Library- We use Boost throughout our code, e.g., Boost.Spirit for parsing;- We have our own range library, in the same spirit as Boost.Range or Eric Niebler’s range-v3, but going further, for example, by unifying internal and external iteration. We gave a talk about it, and most of the code is public;- We develop our own cross-platform library to support Mac and Windows with a single code base;- We have our own reference-counting and persistence libraries to save and restore whole object trees;- We have an extensive bug reporting infrastructure. Assertions and error checks stay in the release code, and our software automatically reports bugs to our server. The server analyzes the bug, categorizes it and files it in a database that all developers can access. If an update fixes the bug, the user can download the update directly from a bug response web page.Algorithms- think-cell was founded on the idea for an algorithm for automatic slide layout, and we are still on an exciting journey towards that ambitious vision. You can see our most recent release in action!- We developed a new algorithm for automatic point cloud labeling that allows labels to be positioned away from the actual points;- We developed a new algorithm for automatic column chart labeling;- We are working with John Forrest – author of the linear solver CLP – to make his simplex code faster on our kind of problems;- We developed many generic data structures that are not in C++ or Boost, for example partitions;- Our software not only produces charts, it is also able read them back from paper. For our chart recognition tool, we rely on OpenCV and the Leptonica Image Processing Library;Reverse Engineering- We do lots of reverse engineering with the disassembler IDA from Hex-Rays, in order to achieve things that are not possible via the documented Microsoft Office API;- We wrote probably the best function hooking engine out there. On each start of our software, we patch the Microsoft Office executables in memory. Rather than hard-coding patch addresses, we search for small chunks of assembly code to be robust against minor changes in the executables.About this jobWe are looking for smart, creative developers with a solid theoretical background. Our team of developers consists of those with 15+ years of commercial experience in various fields, to fresh graduates in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. A university degree or work experience with C++, together with a fresh and creative problem-solving approach would be an excellent combination for this role. As all of our recruitment steps are task-based, the selection is based on the skills demonstrated during our tests.You will work largely independently and will be responsible for the whole range of activities when implementing a new feature. You should be able to look at a problem from the user's perspective and discuss abstract concepts with fellow developers. We expect each of our developers to do architecture, design, implementation, customer feedback and bug fixing, rather than splitting these activities between several people. We thus put everyone in control of their own work.At think-cell, there are no deadlines, and no scheduled meetings. A feature is ready to be released when you are convinced that you have implemented the best possible solution. Meetings take place as needed, with only the people that are actually involved being required to be present. At any time in the process, ideas, suggestions and criticism from anybody in the hierarchy is welcome and is seriously considered. Your ideas are welcome, even if they mean that we have to change a lot of code to make things better.We have published several scientific articles in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics and we will encourage you to do the same. We sponsor visits to conferences and have close relationships with universities and research institutes in the U.S. and Germany.think-cell encourages a healthy work-life balance. We do not work at night or on weekends, and support our staff's families with a full-time company nanny. She is available for free when children are sick, or when you just feel like spending an evening out.We pay very competitive salaries and offer our developers EUR 130,000 annually following one year of employment. If necessary, we will go out of our way to help you relocate to Berlin, and will do what we can to help you acquire a work permit. While you should be able to communicate effectively in English, knowing German is not required. German language courses can be arranged, if desired."

YMM has engineering/dev subsidiaries in Ukraine, Belarus and Poland, where it has built Global YO - an eSIM enabled entertainment and connectivity app available in over 100 countries with geo-located recommendations and music, movies and games on the go. Global YO is the traveler's best friend. Currently we are looking for a BI Analyst to make the team even stronger. About the BI Analyst role:The BI Analyst is responsible for managing data retrieval and analysis within the Company. Their duties include organizing data points from multiple software sources, communicating between upper management and the IT department and analyzing data to help determine product and business priorities, reporting the CEO. The first role of the BI Analyst is to relentlessly seek out data supported clues as to the weaknesses and strengths of the company’s business and to rank business opportunities and priorities. The BI Analyst will often work with the product department as a customer advocate and with the business units and an investor/investment return advocate beholden to no one.Tasks and responsibilities:- Transform data from various software sources into insight that can help to improve the value of the business- Take ownership, improve, scale and iterate on existing data processing pipelines, design and implement new data processing pipelines- Redesign the Company’s data architecture to produce data feed for analytics to support product, marketing and business decision-making process- Collect and monitor performance metrics- Identify from data-analytics and then report and lobby for business, product and marketing opportunities- Collaborate with team members for the purpose of collecting data and setting data retrieval criteriaYou have:- 1+ years of experience as a Data Engineer/BI Engineer- Thorough understanding of SQL and Relational Databases (Amazon Redshift, PostgreSQL)- Hand-on experience with ETL pipelines creation, implementation, and maintenance- Hand-on experience with Tableau You are:- Entrepreneurial- Able to instinctively recognize trends, patters, inconsistencies- Tech savvy/confident able to master new applications quickly- Methodical, always testing, second guessing- Restless – nothing is ever settled- CollaborativeWhat we offer: - Work with a brilliant software team with a high level of collaboration and desire to achieve goals - Flexible working hours- Competitive salary- Corporate equipment for job related tasks- The possibility of personal and professional growthOur Company Cultural Pillars (what we look for in our team members):1. Views technology as progress for humanity: You don’t necessarily need to be the most early adopter of early adopters, but at YMM we firmly believe that technology, when used correctly and when access is given equitably, should improve the human experience, and we’re looking for likeminded team members. 2. Innovative, optimistic, curious, and thinks outside the box: Although introspection, reflection and research are fundamental to a healthy business, to build an “Adhocracy” we are looking for people who are willing to believe in crazy ideas. An idea for how to practice this: in your next team brainstorm, instead of defining all the reasons an idea won’t work, try listing all the reasons it might work.3. Humility & willingness to grow: “Everyone in the world is better than you at something.” The smartest people always know that they’re not the smartest person, and stay open to constructive feedback (from anyone - not just their superiors) as a tool for continuous growth. The humility to receive feedback without becoming defensive or pointing fingers is crucial to YO’s culture. And of course, feedback should always be given following the “Radical Candor” style. (Radical Candor is required reading!) 4. World-class communicators: When in doubt, overcommunicate. Imagine how many problems in the world have been caused by miscommunication or misunderstandings caused by less-than-perfect communication. We’ve all been there - you walk away from an interaction thinking that the other person understood you perfectly, yet find out a few days later that they had a completely different takeaway of the conversation as you did. This is especially a challenge for globally distributed teams who work in several different languages and time zones. We are looking to build a team of world-class communicators (whether written or verbal, but ideally both) in order to improve efficiency, productivity, and happiness at YO (less misunderstandings equals happier workplace). (Required reading: The Story of Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody)5. Proactive & problem-solving attitude: Nobody wants to work with somebody who only brings problems to the table and not solutions. We’re looking for people who will lead brainstorms, suggest ways to help their coworkers solve problems, or be willing to roll up their sleeves and jump in if their help/skillset is needed (the “no task too small” attitude). We expect that the first response to a problem is to start finding solutions."

If so, you have probably written so much Python code in your life that at times you want to express your thoughts through list comprehensions.

We’d like to improve it even further with you on the team.The demand for our work is extremely high, so we get to pick and choose the projects that we want to take on – and the same goes for you. Before you’re assigned to a project, you’ll be personally asked if you’re interested in that particular task and if you don’t like it, you’ll just get something else. That’s the beauty of having a sales team that greatly outperforms our delivery capacity.Let your code have a real impactAt Reef Technologies, we don’t have managers. Thanks to the group decision-making framework, Sociocracy 3.0, every member of the team can be sure that their opinion will be valued.

The Founder of our company doesn’t only take care of sales, bureaucracy, and client relationships - he is also a programmer, so all of us really do work together and understand the job at hand.What type of projects would you work on? We mainly accept offers from startups and small-to-medium businesses from the US, the UK, and Canada. Some projects may only last a couple of hours, while others take even a few years for us to complete. There is one thing that you can be sure of, though - that it will always be your personal choice whether to work on a particular project or reject it.

Some of us work early in the morning, others start off late in the night. Each of us is free to choose their own programming environment. We know our engineers are competent enough to organize their work and achieve top productivity in their own way. Do you think you'd enjoy this type of freedom?
